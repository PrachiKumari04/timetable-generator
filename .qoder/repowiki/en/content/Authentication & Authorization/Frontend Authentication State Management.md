#### Enhanced Initial State Setup
The slice now includes comprehensive state management for JWT tokens:
- isAuthenticated: Boolean flag indicating user authentication status
- userData: User object containing token information
- loading: Boolean flag for async operation states (starts as true)
- error: Error object for authentication failures

#### Async Thunk Implementation
The system implements verifySession async thunk for automatic session verification:
- Uses createAsyncThunk for standardized async state management
- Handles pending, fulfilled, and rejected states automatically
- Integrates with API client for backend session validation
- Provides comprehensive error handling with rejectWithValue

#### Enhanced Reducer Functions
The slice provides improved reducers with better state management:

**Login Reducer**
- Sets isAuthenticated to true
- Updates userData with token information
- Clears error state on successful authentication
- Sets loading to false after successful login

**Logout Reducer**
- Resets authentication state to null/false
- Clears error state
- Maintains clean state cleanup

```mermaid

class AuthSlice {
+initialState : Object
+reducers : Object
+extraReducers : Builder
+verifySession : AsyncThunk
+login(state, action)
+logout(state)
}
class AsyncThunk {
+verifySession : createAsyncThunk
+predicate : "auth/verifySession"
+pending(state)
+fulfilled(state, action)
+rejected(state)
}
class TokenState {
+access_token : String
+refresh_token : String
+expires_at : Date
}

The main store configuration remains focused but now manages the enhanced authentication slice with other application slices.

#### Store Composition
The store includes:
- auth: Enhanced authentication state management with JWT tokens
- theme: UI theme preferences
- admin: Administrative data management
- form: Form state management

**Section sources**
- [store.js:1-15](file://Client/src/store/store.js#L1-L15)

### Enhanced Login Component Integration
The Login component demonstrates comprehensive JWT authentication flow with token management and automatic role-based redirection.

#### Enhanced Authentication Flow
1. User submits login form with credentials
2. Component validates form inputs and prevents submission if invalid
3. Component calls authentication API with token support
4. On successful authentication, extracts access_token and refresh_token
5. Dispatches login action with complete token information
6. Uses useEffect hook for automatic role-based redirection
7. Updates Redux state with token information

#### Automatic Role-Based Redirection
The component implements a new useEffect hook that automatically redirects users based on their role:
- Checks isAuthenticated and userData.role on state changes
- Redirects admin users to /admin
- Redirects student users to /student
- Redirects faculty users to /faculty
- Uses replace: true to prevent back navigation

#### Enhanced Token Management
The component implements comprehensive token handling:
- Extracts both access_token and refresh_token from API response
- Stores tokens in userData for Redux state
- Provides role-based navigation with token validation
- Implements proper error handling for token extraction failures

#### Enhanced Role-Based Navigation
The component implements robust role-based routing:
- Admin users navigate to /admin with token validation
- Student users navigate to /student with token validation
- Faculty users navigate to /faculty with token validation
- Other roles navigate to home with proper error handling

- [Student.jsx:5-35](file://Client/src/pages/dashboard/Student.jsx#L5-L35)

## Enhanced Authentication Flow
The enhanced authentication system implements a sophisticated flow that properly differentiates between initial session verification and login submission states.

### Initial Session Verification
When the application loads, the verifySession async thunk runs automatically:
- Sets loading state to true initially
- Calls /users/me endpoint to validate existing session
- Handles success by setting isAuthenticated to true
- Handles failure by resetting authentication state
- Sets loading to false after completion

### Login Submission State
During login submission, the system properly distinguishes between:
- Initial session verification (loading state from verifySession)
- Login submission (isSubmitting state from form)
- Both states are tracked separately to prevent conflicts

### Automatic Redirection Logic
The Login component implements intelligent redirection logic:
- Uses useEffect to watch for authentication state changes
- Differentiates between initial verification and login submission
- Prevents double redirection during login process
- Handles role-based navigation based on user data

### Enhanced Error Handling for Session Verification
The system now includes critical improvements to prevent infinite redirect loops:
- Response interceptor checks for /users/me endpoint failures
- Skips token refresh attempts for session verification failures
- Prevents redirect cycles when no active session exists
- Allows graceful fallback to login page
